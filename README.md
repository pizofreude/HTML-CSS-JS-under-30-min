## HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language

**Definition&colon;** The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

You can also work with embedded CSS and JavaScript. However, note that script and style includes from other files are not followed, the language support only looks at the content of the HTML file.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages.

HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

Filename extension: .html

## CSS = Cascading Style Sheets

**Definition:** CSS is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML).

Filename extension: .css

## JavaScript = High-level programming language

**Definition:** JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.

It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.

It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model (DOM).

"TLDR:

- JavaScript is the Programming Language for the Web.

- JavaScript can update and change both HTML and CSS.

- JavaScript can calculate, manipulate and validate data."

## Prerequisite

1. Get yourself a text editor. The text editor used for this lesson is VS Code.

   - Install VS Code locally in your machine: [VS Code Installer.](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - Use VS Code Online Tool: [VS Code Dev.](https://vscode.dev/)

2. Install essential extensions for HTML | CSS | JS:
   - HTML CSS Support
   - Live Server
   - Path Intellisense
   - html tag wrapper
   - open in browser

3. Familiarize with some shortcuts in VS Code:
   - `ctrl + shift + i` or `F12` = Toggle developer tools in web browser.
   - `ctrl + ]` = Indent code block to the right.
   - `ctrl + [` = Indent code block to the left.
   - `ctrl + shift + K` = Delete line.
   - `ctrl + /` = Toggle line as comment.
   - `select lines + ctrl + /` = Toggle lines as comment.
   - `ctrl + shift + P` or `F1` = "TLDR: Show all commands." Command Palette pops up. It brings up a magical textbox with a angle bracket > string in it that you can type in to access commands, like >fold all.
   - `Ctrl+Space` = Trigger auto-complete suggestions.
   - `alt + L` = Toggle Start/Stop Live Server (Requirement: Install Live Server extension).
   - `alt + down arrow key` = Move a line down. Multiple lines selection is possible.
   - `alt + up arrow key` = Move a line up. Multiple lines selection is possible.
   - `! + tab or enter` = Generate HTML5 Skeleton.
   - `.nav + tab` = Generate div with class nav.

     ```html
       <div class="nav"></div>

   - `.navbar + tab` = Generate div with class navbar.

      ```html
       <div class="navbar"></div>

   - `ul.navbar-nav>li+li+li + tab` = Generate custom structure/skeleton with class navbar-nav with 3 li childrens. Do not use dot operator, otherwise div will be created instead of the desired skeleton. This method is applicable to any custom skeletons. Arithmetics operations works!

     ```html
      <ul class="navbar-nav">
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
          <li></li>
      </ul>

   - `li*3` = This creates multiple Elements.

      ```html
      <li></li>
      <li></li>
      <li></li>

   - `nav>ul>li` = This creates nested Elements.

      ```html
      <nav>
         <ul>
            <li></li>
         </ul>
      </nav>

   - `a{Click Me}` = This creates Tags with text.

      ```html
      <a href="">Click Me</a>

   - `div.first-class.second-class` = This creates Elements with multiple classes.

      ```html
      <div class="first-class second-class"></div>

   - `div#main` = This creates Elements with IDs.

      ```html
      <div id="main"></div>
